    "- Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?\n",
    "- In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work (for example if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model. Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least 3 settings. Use the entire training set for this.\n",
    "- What is the model's final F<sub>1</sub> score?\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Model\n",
    "I selected the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm when compared to both random forests and k-nearest neighbors. The SVM algorithm has the best performance when dealing with unseen data -- it has the highest F1 score on the test data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it does have the highest computational cost for training time (12 ms with 300 students) among the three models, the higher performance on F1 score is worth a few milliseconds since this isn't a real time application (like a self-driving automobile) with demanding time constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Theory of Operation\n",
    "If you put all of the student data on a multi-dimensional scatterplot there are linear boundaries that you can imagine between at-risk students and all other students. Support vector machines attempts to find the optimal separating lines between these two groups by drawing lines (or planes) between the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are many such possible separating borders that can be drawn, SVM selects lines that have the most amount of margin (or padding) between the two types of students. This allows SVM to better generalize and predict student performance with data it hasn't seen previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine Tuning\n",
    "I used the entire training set with GridSearchCV, which iterates over many parameters and finds the parameters achieving the best score (in this case F1).\n",
    "\n",
    "One difference between the original results and when using GridSearch is that the latter also does cross-validation as part of its process.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearch ultimately selected a C value (penalty parameter) of 1.0, which is actually the default. It also selected a gamma (kernel coefficient) of 0.06, which is slightly different than the default of 1/n_features (1/30).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final F1 score is 0.82 for the training set and 0.75 for the test set.\n"
